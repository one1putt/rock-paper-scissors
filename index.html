        // interesting: I have not been using ;'s' but without it after the game call above, I get a TypeError that game is not a function. the error comes after game() executes and the lines below try to get executed. if i add the semi it works fine. If I do a formal if/else (see below) then it works without the semi; if i eliminate the () around wins === 3 then it works without the semi. I read that you have to be careful of lines that start with a ( since it thinks this is part of the previous line.

        wins === 3 ? console.log(`Congrats!! You won ${wins} to ${losses}.`) : console.log(`You lost ${wins} to ${losses}.`)

        // if (wins === 3) {
        //     console.log(`Congrats!! You won ${wins} to ${losses}.`)
        // }
        // else {
        //     console.log(`You lost ${wins} to ${losses}.`)
        // }
