# rock-paper-scissors

### computer choice
- looked up how to randomly pick from an array and got the shown solution. seemed like a simple elegant approach.
- tested in console and was able to get each choice picked.

### round
- implemented the function to play a round and determine the winner
- currently only report a tie if there is a tie. will work on this later.
- changed player input to lower case to make it case insensative.

### game
- the game engine was hard coded to be best of 5
- it will end if a winner is determined before 5 rounds.
- i decided to use wins and losses as global variables rather than return them from the game. would be better to return them but not sure yet how to return more than one value in a function
