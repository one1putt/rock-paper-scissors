### computer choice
- looked up how to randomly pick from an array and got the shown solution. seemed like a simple elegant approach.
- tested in console and was able to get each choice picked.

### round
- implemented the function to play a round and determine the winner
- currently only report a tie if there is a tie. will work on this later.
- changed player input to lower case to make it case insensative.
